# Archive of Old Projects

This repository is a little corner where I keep projects that have been archived from other repositories that I created before.
Here, you’ll find those old or discontinued projects that might still be useful for reference or learning.

## Why Were They Archived?
These projects are here for a few reasons:

- **Mission Accomplished**: The project fulfilled its purpose and doesn’t need any more updates.
- **Outdated**: It was replaced by something newer or more practical.
- **Indefinite Pause**: Development stopped, but who knows? Maybe it’ll come back someday.

## What’s Inside?
Each folder represents an archived project. 
Inside, you’ll find the source code for each project that’s been set aside, but it might still be reused or serve as inspiration.

Take a look—you never know, something here might come in handy!
